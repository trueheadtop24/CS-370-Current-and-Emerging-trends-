 What I Did

In this project, I made a pirate computer helper that learns how to find treasure in a maze. I was given some starter code that built the maze and let the pirate move around. I added the code that helps the pirate learn on its own.

The pirate learns by trying moves, making mistakes, and getting better each time. When it does something right, like finding the treasure, it gets a reward. When it hits a wall, it loses a few points. After many tries, the pirate figures out the best way to reach the treasure

 What I Learned

This project helped me see how computers can learn by practicing, just like people do. The pirate canâ€™t actually see the maze it just uses numbers to know where it is. It remembers what moves worked best and uses that to make smarter choices next time.

At first, the pirate tries random moves to learn. Later, it starts using what it learned to move faster. This mix of exploring and remembering helped it win most of the time. I used something called deep Q-learning, which helps computers learn from good and bad choices.

What Computer Scientists Do

Computer scientists make smart programs and solve problems using computers. Their work helps people like creating apps, games, robots, and other tools that make life easier and more fun.

 How I Solve Problems

I learned to fix big problems by breaking them into small steps. First, I tested if the pirate could move. Next, I added rewards and made it remember what worked. Then I tested it again until it learned to find the treasure every time.

Being Responsible

As a computer scientist, I have to make sure my programs are fair, safe, and honest. I should always think about how my work affects people and use what I build to help others, not harm them
